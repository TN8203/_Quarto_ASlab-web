## Introduction

Publishing in reputable journals is a key part of academic research. This article offers a concise overview of three widely recognized journal indexing systems: **ISI**, **ESCI**, and **SCOPUS**. Understanding these systems helps researchers choose suitable journals for disseminating their work.

## ISI-Indexed Journals

**ISI** stands for *Institute of Scientific Information* (USA). It is a prestigious indexing system used to evaluate the quality of scientific journals. Originally, it focused on **SCI (Science Citation Index)**, which included high-quality journals in science, technology, and engineering. Later, it expanded to:

- **SCIE** (Science Citation Index Expanded)
- **SSCI** (Social Sciences Citation Index)
- **A&HCI** (Arts & Humanities Citation Index)

As of today, ISI covers around **12,000 journals**, all of which are widely recognized for scientific rigor.

### How to check if a journal is ISI-indexed:

1. Visit the [Master Journal List](https://mjl.clarivate.com/search-results)
2. Search by journal name or ISSN.

## ESCI-Indexed Journals

**ESCI (Emerging Sources Citation Index)** includes newer or emerging journals. Launched in 2015, ESCI is managed by **Clarivate** (previously by Thomson Reuters). These journals are not part of the ISI Core Collection but are under evaluation for inclusion in SCIE, SSCI, or A&HCI.

- ESCI currently includes **8,200+ journals**.
- You can search for ESCI journals the same way as ISI journals via the Master Journal List.

## SCOPUS-Indexed Journals

**Scopus** is an indexing system launched in 2004 by Elsevier, containing over **44,000 journals** as of the end of 2022. Unlike ISI, Scopus uses **Quantile rankings (Q1â€“Q4)** by subject area to assess journal impact.

- A journal with a higher **Quantile (e.g., Q1 or 90%)** is considered more reputable in its field.

### Example journals in economics and finance indexed by Scopus:

- *Quarterly Journal of Economics*
- *Journal of Management*
- *American Economic Journal: Applied Economics*
- *Resources, Conservation and Recycling*

### How to check if a journal is Scopus-indexed:

1. Visit: [https://www.scopus.com/sources.uri](https://www.scopus.com/sources.uri)
2. Search by journal name or ISSN.

## Conclusion

Understanding these journal classifications can help researchers strategically choose where to publish, increasing visibility and credibility within the academic community.
