<div class="h1">Hi, guys!</div>

The Actuarial Science in Finance and Insurance (AS Lab) at [NEU College of Technology](https://nct.neu.edu.vn/) is a specialized unit that researches mathematical and statistical methods to assess and manage risks in insurance, finance, and related fields.  

With a team of experienced experts, the research department focuses on developing quantitative models to forecast risks, optimize financial strategies, and support decision-making for businesses and organizations.  

In addition to research and application orientation, AS Lab was also established with the aim of helping passionate students/trainees have the opportunity to study, research, and participate in practical work related to Actuarial Science.
